# Description
This file contains three videos that demonstrate the performance and generalization capabilities of the proposed framework for tactile-driven dexterous in-hand writing.

__1.mp4__: This video demonstrates real-world experiments, covering:1）Experiment Setup: overview of the hardware, including the three-finger robotic hand and the ABB IRB1100 robotic arm；2）Generalization Tests: evaluation across various writing tools, writing surfaces, and writing trajectories；3）Ablation Study: comparison of different policy variations, analyzing the impact of compliant control and extrinsic contact perception on task performance.

__2.mp4__: This video showcases the trained trajectories in simulation, including circles, straight lines, heart shapes, figure eights, and a spiral. The blue lines represent the actual trajectories generated by the system, while the red lines indicate the target trajectories, highlighting the system's accuracy in following diverse patterns.

__3.mp4__: This video presents the framework’s generalization to unseen trajectories in simulation, specifically showcasing various digits.
